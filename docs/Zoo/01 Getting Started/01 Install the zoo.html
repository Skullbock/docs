<div class="box-warning">When you are facing an error during installation, it is highly recommended to try to <em>install from directory</em>:
	<ol class="bold">
		<li>Download the latest ZOO version and unpack the the Extension's archive file in a temporary directory on your local hard drive .</li>
		<li>Using FTP, upload the contents of this directory (including files and subdirectories) to a directory on your server ususally the <em>/tmp</em> directory.</li>
		<li>Go to the extensions installer in the Joomla! administration, in the Install Directory field specify the directory where you have uploaded the files and subdirectories of the package.</li>
		<li>Click on the Install button and Joomla! will install the contents of the given directory.</li>
