<h1 class="title">Create a new ZOO module theme</h1>

<p>This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating a new module theme for the ZOO 2.0 extension. We will show the steps on the basis of the ZOO item module.</p>


<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>All the files for a ZOO module are usually located in <em>/modules/MODULE/</em>.</p>

<p>For the ZOO item module for example the path is <em>/modules/mod_zooitem/</em>.</p>

<p>In the folder <em>/tmpl/</em> all files for the theme are stored. The folder <em>/renderer/item/</em> contains all files for the layouts.</p>


<h2>Creating a new theme</h2>

<p>The themes of a ZOO module are stored in the folder <em>/tmpl/</em> of the module folder, for example for the ZOO item module, the folder is:

<em>/modules/mod_zooitem/tmpl/</em>.

<p>The easiest way to create a new theme is to have a look at the existing ones and copy the code and then change it to your needs. Give the file a new name like myliststyle.php</p>

<p>Then just add your new myliststyle.php file to <em>/modules/mod_zooitem/tmpl/</em>.</p>

<p>For every template there is a folder with all images and css styles. You have to create this folder for your new style and create the css files. Please don�t forget to change the paths in the myliststyle.php to your newly created folders.</p>

<p>As themes are unique for every module, we won't get into detail here. There is a longer tutorial explaining the customization of templates {doc: create-a-new-template text: here} that can be adapted.</p>
