<h1 class="title">How to update</h1>

<p>Here is a brief instruction on how to update a theme based on the Warp framework without uninstalling and reinstalling the template.</p>

<h2>Update your theme</h2>

<p>When you open the template settings a notice notify you whenever a new version of your template is available.Notifications are smart and won't bother you with any messages unless an update is available for your template.</p>

<p>Usually after you download a template it will be customized to meet the requirements of your website. In this process you will change images, add some HTML or do CSS modifications here and there.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the template settings the new file verification quickly shows you all the modified and missing files in your template that differ from the version you got from our download section. Now you instantly know which files you have modified in your customization before you start updating your individual template with the new template version.</p>

<p>
	To update your template do the following steps:

	<ol>
		<li>First of all make a backup of all the customized template files, so you can recover it and redo all changes at any time.</li>
		<li>Download the latest template version and extract the files.</li>
		<li>Copy all files to <em>templates/TEMPLATENAME/</em> <strong>(Joomla)</strong> or <em>themes/THEMENAME</em> <strong>(Wordpress)</strong> and replace all files.</li>
		<li>Redo your changes by merging your customized files with the new ones</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>To never have trouble with updating your theme we recommend that you write all your custom CSS styles into the file custom.css. That is the purpose of the custom.css file. Also check out the tutorial on how to make your template access custom CSS and JavaScript files.</p>
